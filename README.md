# Sockets-server

Goal
● Understand about what sockets are
● Understanding about threads
● Building socket server in Python

Sockets allow communication between two different processes (or applications) on the same or different machines.

They are used in a client-server application framework. Servers are backend applications (or processes) that perform some functions on a request from the client.
